## Grid generation

Each run creates a square map with a randomly selected side length from 8 to 16 cells. About 15% of its cells contain static walls; each map also has one trap and one treasure. Select **Regenerate Grid** below the grid to generate a new grid.

## Sample Grid

## Requirements

**Python 3.10 or newer** (developed on 3.13). The code uses the `X | Y` type-union syntax, which raises a `TypeError` on Python 3.9 and older. Check your version with:

```bash
python3 --version   # macOS / Linux
py --version        # Windows
```

If it is older than 3.10, install a newer Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or `brew install python@3.13` on macOS) before continuing. The `.python-version` file records the version the project was developed with, for tools like `pyenv` and `uv`.

## Set up the virtual environment

Run these commands from the project folder. A virtual environment is tied to the Python that created it, so create it with a 3.10+ interpreter. If you have an old `.venv` from an older Python, delete it first (`rm -rf .venv` on macOS, `rmdir /s /q .venv` on Windows).

### Windows

Create the environment:

```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
```

Use any installed 3.10+ version in place of `3.13`.

Activate it in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Or activate it in Command Prompt:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### macOS

Create the environment:

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
```

Use `python3` instead if `python3 --version` already reports 3.10 or newer, or substitute any installed 3.10+ version for `3.13`.

Activate it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies (Pygame) listed in `requirements.txt`:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the game

From the project folder, with the virtual environment activated, run:

```sh
python main.py
```

To exit the environment on either platform, run:

```bash
deactivate
```
